# CustomiseStartingNPRs
Aurora 4x patch to enable "starting NPR" customisation

To play, here are the patch files - https://github.com/AbsolutelyNoFires/CustomiseStartingNPRs/tree/main/CustomiseStartingNPRs

When this patch is active, starting a game with "starting NPRs" will pop up the empire customisation form.
Remember to tick NPR! Otherwise they'll be a player race.
